# üîò ATmega16 LED Control with Button ‚Äì Embedded Project

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective embedded system using **ATmega16** microcontroller. The goal is to control **7 LEDs** connected to the same port as a **push button**. When the user **presses the button**, all LEDs **turn on for one second**, then **turn off automatically**.

## üß† Project Overview

### üîπ Objective

- Use **Port A** of **ATmega16** for both **output (LEDs)** and **input (Button)**.
- When the **button is pressed**, the 7 LEDs **turn on for 1 second**, then **automatically turn off**.

### üîπ Components Used

- ATmega16 Microcontroller
- 7x LEDs
- 1x Push Button
- Resistors
- Breadboard or Proteus simulation
- Optional: External Crystal (for timing stability)

## üîå Circuit Description

- **PORTA** pins are connected to 7 LEDs (PA0 to PA6) and 1 push button (PA7).
- The push button is configured as input with internal or external pull-up.
- All LEDs are configured as outputs.
- On button press (logic low), the microcontroller turns on all LEDs, waits 1 second, then turns them off.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Simulation (Proteus)

1. Open `FINALPROJECT.pdsprj` in **Proteus**.
2. Double-click on the **ATmega16** component.
3. In the **Program File** section, load the `FINA.hex` file.
4. Run the simulation.
5. Press the virtual push button.
6. You should see all 7 LEDs turn on for 1 second, then turn off.
